## 🧠 Codex Prompt: Initial Project Bootstrap for The Praxis Institute

> You are going to help me build a new AI-powered education platform called **The Praxis Institute**, focused on teaching healthcare analytics. This project will be built in **Next.js with TypeScript**, using **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
>
> Here's what I need you to do step by step:
>
> ---
>
> **1. Set up the project structure**
>
> * Use `create-next-app` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
> * Create the following top-level pages:
>
>   * `/` — Landing page
>   * `/signup` — Signup form
>   * `/courses` — Course catalog
>   * `/profile` — User profile dashboard
>
> **2. Landing Page (`/`)**
>
> * Simple layout with:
>
>   * Header: “Welcome to The Praxis Institute”
>   * Subheading: “An AI-powered academy for mastering healthcare analytics”
>   * A button that links to `/signup`
>   * Section showing two initial courses:
>
>     * SQL for Healthcare Analytics
>     * Intro to Healthcare Analytics
>   * Section showing “Coming soon” content:
>
>     * Python for Health Data Science
>     * Gamified Progress
>
> **3. Signup Page (`/signup`)**
>
> * Basic form to collect:
>
>   * Name
>   * Email
>   * Learning goal (e.g., dropdown or free text)
>   * Preferred track (SQL, Intro to Analytics, etc.)
>
> **4. Courses Page (`/courses`)**
>
> * Cards or tiles for each course
> * Clicking a course routes to `/courses/[courseId]`
>
> **5. Profile Page (`/profile`)**
>
> * Placeholder showing course progress (use mock data)
> * Include sections for:
>
>   * Earned points
>   * Completed modules
>   * Suggested next steps
>
> **6. General Layout**
>
> * Use Tailwind for styling
> * Keep it clean, elegant, and simple — avoid anything too flashy or gamified just yet
>
> **7. Optional Enhancements**
>
> * Set up routing with dynamic routes for courses (`/courses/[slug]`)
> * Use a layout component to share a consistent header/footer
> * Scaffold placeholder modules for videos, quizzes, and labs (basic component only)
>
> ---
>
> Once this base is scaffolded, I’ll come back to you for the next phase: integrating authentication, course content delivery, and gamification mechanics.
